# Solution: Debug LLM prompt
async def plan(self, task: TaskContext) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Add debug logging
    logger.debug(f"Planning for task: {task.task_description}")

    prompt = self._build_planning_prompt(task)
    logger.debug(f"Planning prompt: {prompt}")

    plan = await self.llm_manager.generate_plan(prompt)
    logger.debug(f"Generated plan: {plan}")

    return plan
```

#### Problem: Tool execution fails with validation error
```python
# Error: "Tool parameter validation failed"
# Solution: Check tool schema
tool = self.tool_registry.get_tool("my_tool")

```python
# Issue: Multi-step tasks taking too long
# Solution: Enable parallel execution
async def execute_plan(self, plan: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    # Identify independent steps
    independent_steps = self._find_independent_steps(plan)

    # Execute in parallel
    tasks = [self.execute_step(step) for step in independent_steps]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    return results
```

#### Problem: High memory usage
```python
# Issue: Memory grows during long-running tasks
# Solution: Implement cleanup
async def cleanup_step(self, step_result: Dict):
    # Clear large objects from memory
    del step_result['large_data']

    # Force garbage collection periodically
    if self.step_count % 10 == 0:
        gc.collect()
```

#### Problem: Database query timeouts
```sql
-- Issue: Complex queries timing out
-- Solution: Add indexes and optimize
CREATE INDEX idx_table_column ON table(column);
ANALYZE TABLE table;  -- Update statistics

-- Use query optimization
EXPLAIN SELECT ...;  -- Check execution plan
```

---

### Safety & Security Issues

#### Problem: Approval workflow not triggering
```python
# Error: "High-risk operation executed without approval"
# Solution: Verify safety configuration
def validate_safety(self, step: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    risk_level = self._assess_risk(step)

    # Debug: Log risk assessment
    logger.info(f"Step risk level: {risk_level}")

    requires_approval = risk_level in ['high', 'critical']

    return {
        'requires_approval': requires_approval,
        'safe': risk_level != 'critical',
        'risk_level': risk_level
    }
```

#### Problem: SQL injection detected but not blocked
```python
# Error: "Dangerous SQL pattern detected but executed"
# Solution: Strengthen validation
def validate_sql(self, sql: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    dangerous_patterns = [
        r';\s*DROP\s+TABLE',
        r';\s*DELETE\s+FROM',
        r'--.*',
        r'/\*.*\*/',
        r'UNION\s+SELECT',
        r'xp_cmdshell'
    ]

    for pattern in dangerous_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, sql, re.IGNORECASE):
            raise SecurityError(f"Dangerous SQL pattern: {pattern}")

    return {'safe': True}
```

```

**Q: How do I handle agent failures?**
A: Implement error handling with checkpoints:
```python
try:
    result = await agent.run(task)
except AgentError as e:
    # Restore from last checkpoint
    await agent.restore_checkpoint(last_checkpoint_id)
    # Retry with modified parameters
    result = await agent.run(modified_task)
```

**Q: What's the maximum number of agents I can run?**
A: Limited by system resources. Typical deployments handle 10-50 concurrent agents. Use resource monitoring and scaling strategies for larger deployments.

---

### Safety Questions

## 📈 Performance Optimization Tips

### LLM Optimization
```python
# Use streaming for faster response
async for chunk in llm_manager.stream_generate(prompt):
    process_chunk(chunk)

# Cache frequent prompts
@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def build_prompt(task_type: str) -> str:
    return template.render(task_type=task_type)

# Use smaller models for simple tasks
if task.complexity == 'simple':
    config.llm_model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'  # Faster, cheaper
else:
    config.llm_model = 'gpt-4'  # More capable
```

### Database Optimization
```python
# Use connection pooling
pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    dsn=connection_string,
    min_size=10,
    max_size=20
)

# Batch operations
async def batch_insert(records: List[Dict]):
    async with pool.acquire() as conn:
        await conn.executemany(
            'INSERT INTO table VALUES ($1, $2)',
            [(r['field1'], r['field2']) for r in records]
        )

# Use prepared statements
statement = await conn.prepare('SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1')
result = await statement.fetchrow(user_id)
```

### Memory Optimization
```python
# Use generators for large datasets
async def process_large_dataset():
    async for batch in fetch_batches():
        yield process_batch(batch)
        # Memory freed after each batch

# Implement cleanup
async def cleanup_resources():
    # Clear caches
    cache.clear()
    # Close connections
    await pool.close()
    # Force garbage collection
    gc.collect()
```

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Credential Management
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use environment variables
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# ❌ WRONG: Hardcoded credentials
api_key = 'sk-...'  # NEVER DO THIS

# ✅ CORRECT: Use encrypted vault
vault = CredentialVault()
credentials = await vault.get_credentials('database')
```

### Input Validation
```python
# Always validate and sanitize inputs
def validate_input(user_input: str) -> str:
    # Remove dangerous characters
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[;&|`$]', '', user_input)

    # Validate length
    if len(cleaned) > 1000:
        raise ValueError("Input too long")

    # Validate format
    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', cleaned):
        raise ValueError("Invalid characters")

    return cleaned
```

### Audit Logging
```python
# Log all sensitive operations
async def execute_sensitive_operation(operation: Dict):
    audit_logger.info(
        'sensitive_operation',
        operation_type=operation['type'],
        user=operation['user'],
        timestamp=datetime.now(),
        parameters=sanitize_for_logging(operation['params'])
    )

    result = await perform_operation(operation)

    audit_logger.info(
        'sensitive_operation_complete',
        result_status='success',
        execution_time=result['execution_time']
    )
```
