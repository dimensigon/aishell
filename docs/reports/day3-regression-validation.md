## Regression Analysis

### Critical Finding: ZERO Regressions
✅ **All 1,943 tests passing at Day 2 end remain passing**
✅ **No previously passing tests regressed**
✅ **Only improvements detected**

### Methodology
1. Compared test results at commit `db20cdf` (Day 2) vs current HEAD
2. Analyzed failing test files for any new failures in previously passing suites
3. Verified all systems touched maintained or improved their test coverage
4. Confirmed no performance degradation
