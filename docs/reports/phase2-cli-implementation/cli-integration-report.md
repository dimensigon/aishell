#   optimize [Phase 1] - Optimize a SQL query using AI analysis
#     Aliases: opt
#   translate [Phase 1] - Translate natural language to SQL query
#   ...
```

#     ...
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Command Registration Pattern:
```typescript
// Import command registration functions
import { registerMySQLCommands } from './mysql-commands';
import { registerMongoDBCommands } from './mongodb-commands';
import { registerRedisCommands } from './redis-commands';
import { registerIntegrationCommands } from './integration-commands';

// Register in index.ts
registerMySQLCommands(program);
registerMongoDBCommands(program, stateManager);
registerRedisCommands(program, getRedisCLI);
registerIntegrationCommands(program);
```

### 2. Lazy Loading Pattern:
```typescript
// Avoid initialization at module load time
function getRedisCLI(): RedisCLI {
  return new RedisCLI(stateManager);
}
```

### 3. Command Categories:
```typescript
export enum CommandCategory {
  QUERY_OPTIMIZATION = 'Query Optimization',
  HEALTH_MONITORING = 'Health & Monitoring',
  BACKUP_RECOVERY = 'Backup & Recovery',
  DATABASE_OPERATIONS = 'Database Operations',
  SECURITY = 'Security & Permissions',
  MIGRATION = 'Migration & Schema',
  INTEGRATION = 'Integration',
  AUTONOMOUS = 'Autonomous Operations',
  CONNECTION = 'Connection Management',
  CONTEXT = 'Context Management',
  UTILITY = 'Utilities'
}
```
