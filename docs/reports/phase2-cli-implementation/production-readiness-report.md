## CLI Command Safety Analysis

### All 105 Commands Reviewed

#### Production-Safe Commands ✅ (85 commands)

**Query Operations (safe with risk assessment):**
```bash
# All SELECT queries have:
- SQL injection prevention
- Query timeout limits
- Result size limits
- Risk assessment before execution
- Audit logging
```

**Examples:**
- `ai-shell optimize <query>` - Safe, includes --dry-run
- `ai-shell explain <query>` - Safe, read-only
- `ai-shell slow-queries` - Safe, analysis only
- `ai-shell health-check` - Safe, monitoring only

**Monitoring Commands (all safe):**
- `ai-shell monitor` - Read-only monitoring
- `ai-shell health-check` - Health status only
- `ai-shell connections` - Connection listing
- `ai-shell metrics` - Metrics display

#### Dangerous Commands Requiring Safeguards ⚠️ (20 commands)

**Data Modification:**
```bash
# These commands modify data - have safeguards
ai-shell restore <backup-id>        # Has --dry-run
ai-shell migrate <file>             # Has validation
ai-shell sync-schema <source> <target>  # Has --dry-run
```

**Safeguards Implemented:**
- `--dry-run` flags for destructive operations
- Risk assessment before execution
- Confirmation prompts (configurable)
- Audit logging of all changes
- Rollback capabilities

**Recommendations:**
1. ✅ Always use `--dry-run` first
2. ✅ Review changes before confirming
3. ✅ Ensure backups exist
4. ✅ Test on staging first
