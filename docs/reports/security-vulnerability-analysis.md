## Vulnerability #1: esbuild Development Server CORS Bypass

### Details
- **Advisory ID:** GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **CVE:** None assigned
- **Affected Package:** esbuild ≤ 0.24.2
- **Current Version:** 0.21.5 (indirect via vite@5.4.21)
- **Fixed Version:** 0.25.0+
- **CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Moderate)
- **CWE:** CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error)

### Technical Description
esbuild's development server sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to all requests, including SSE connections. This bypasses the same-origin policy, allowing any website to send requests to the local development server and read responses.

**Attack Vector:**
```
1. Developer runs local dev server (e.g., vite dev)
2. Developer visits malicious website in browser
3. Malicious JavaScript sends fetch() requests to localhost:5173
4. Attacker reads source code, environment variables, or sensitive data
```

### Impact Assessment
**Severity for AI-Shell:** MODERATE (Development Only)

- **Exploitability:** HIGH - Requires only that developer visits malicious website while dev server is running
- **Scope:** Source code disclosure, potential secrets exposure if hardcoded
- **Production Impact:** NONE - Development server not used in production
- **Attack Prerequisites:**
  - Developer must be running local dev server
  - Developer must visit attacker-controlled website simultaneously
  - Secrets must be accessible via dev server endpoints

### Dependency Chain
```
vitest@2.1.9 → vite@5.4.21 → esbuild@0.21.5 [VULNERABLE]
```

### Remediation Path
**Option 1: Upgrade to vitest v4.0.4 (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest@4.0.4 @vitest/ui@4.0.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@4.0.4
```

**Breaking Changes:**
- Requires Node.js 20.0.0+ or 22.0.0+ or 24.0.0+ (currently requires 18.0.0+)
- Removes support for Vite 5 (requires Vite 6+)
- API changes in test options (use second argument instead of third)
- Mock behavior changes

**Option 2: Stay on vitest v2.x and wait for backport**
- Monitor https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/19428
- Risk: May not be backported to older versions

## Vulnerability #2: xml2js Prototype Pollution

### Details
- **Advisory ID:** GHSA-776f-qx25-q3cc
- **CVE:** CVE-2023-0842
- **Affected Package:** xml2js < 0.5.0
- **Current Version:** 0.4.23 (indirect via map-canvas@0.1.5 via blessed-contrib@4.11.0)
- **Fixed Version:** 0.5.0+
- **CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Moderate)
- **CWE:** CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes)

### Technical Description
xml2js versions before 0.5.0 do not properly validate incoming XML/JSON keys, allowing an external attacker to edit or add properties to JavaScript objects via the `__proto__` property.

**Attack Vector:**
```javascript
// Malicious XML input
<__proto__>
  <isAdmin>true</isAdmin>
</__proto__>

// After parsing with vulnerable xml2js:
Object.prototype.isAdmin = true;
// ALL objects now have isAdmin=true
```

### Impact Assessment
**Severity for AI-Shell:** LOW-MODERATE (Production)

- **Exploitability:** LOW-MODERATE - Requires attacker-controlled XML input to map-canvas
- **Scope:** Dashboard UI component only (src/cli/dashboard-ui.ts)
- **Production Impact:** LIMITED - blessed-contrib is a direct dependency but map-canvas is only used for map widgets
- **Attack Prerequisites:**
  - Application must use map widgets from blessed-contrib
  - Attacker must control map data (GeoJSON/KML files)
  - Current code review shows NO map widgets in use

### Dependency Chain
```
blessed-contrib@4.11.0 → map-canvas@0.1.5 → xml2js@0.4.23 [VULNERABLE]
```

### Usage Analysis
**File:** `/home/claude/AIShell/aishell/src/cli/dashboard-ui.ts`

Current usage:
- ✅ Grid layout: `contrib.grid`
- ✅ Line charts: `contrib.line`
- ✅ Tables: `contrib.table`
- ❌ Map widgets: NOT USED

**Conclusion:** The vulnerable code path (map-canvas) is not currently exercised by the application.

### Remediation Path
**Option 1: Remove blessed-contrib (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
npm uninstall blessed-contrib
```
Re-implement dashboard using base `blessed` library only. Widgets in use (grid, line, table) can be recreated.

**Option 2: Replace with alternative terminal UI library**
```bash
npm install ink react @types/react
# or
npm install cli-ux chalk boxen
```

**Option 3: Wait for blessed-contrib fix (NOT RECOMMENDED)**
- blessed-contrib last published 4 years ago
- Issues average 305 days to close
- Unmaintained project, unlikely to receive security updates

**Option 4: Create fork with updated dependencies**
```bash
# Fork blessed-contrib and update map-canvas dependency
# Update map-canvas to use xml2js@0.6.2
```

## Related Vulnerabilities (Cascade Effects)

### Vulnerability #3-10: vitest, vite, and related packages

All remaining 8 vulnerabilities stem from the esbuild vulnerability cascading through the dependency tree:

| Package | Version | Issue | Fixed In |
|---------|---------|-------|----------|
| vite | 5.4.21 | Via esbuild | 6.1.7+ |
| vitest | 2.1.9 | Via vite | 4.0.0+ |
| @vitest/mocker | 2.1.9 | Via vite | 3.0.0+ |
| @vitest/ui | 2.1.9 | Via vitest | 4.0.0+ |
| @vitest/coverage-v8 | 2.1.9 | Via vitest | 3.0.0+ |
| vite-node | 2.1.9 | Via vite | 3.0.0+ |
| map-canvas | 0.1.5 | Via xml2js | N/A (unmaintained) |
| blessed-contrib | 4.11.0 | Via map-canvas | N/A (unmaintained) |

All of these resolve to the same two root causes: esbuild@0.21.5 and xml2js@0.4.23.

## Recommended Remediation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate (Low Effort, High Impact)
**Timeline:** 1-2 days

1. **Add .npmrc security policy** (5 min)
```bash
# .npmrc
audit-level=moderate
```

2. **Update npm audit exceptions** (10 min)
```json
// package.json
{
  "overrides": {
    "xml2js": "^0.6.2"
  }
}
```
⚠️ **Note:** This may not work if blessed-contrib/map-canvas doesn't support xml2js 0.5+

3. **Document developer security practices** (30 min)
```markdown
# docs/SECURITY_PRACTICES.md
- Don't browse untrusted websites while dev server is running
- Use isolated browser profiles for development
- Review .env files for hardcoded secrets before committing
```

### Phase 2: Short-term (Moderate Effort, High Impact)
**Timeline:** 1 week

**Option A: Upgrade to vitest v4.x + Remove blessed-contrib** (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Step 1: Upgrade vitest to v4.x
npm install --save-dev vitest@4.0.4 @vitest/ui@4.0.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@4.0.4

# Step 2: Remove blessed-contrib
npm uninstall blessed-contrib

# Step 3: Verify tests pass
npm test

# Step 4: Update Node.js requirement
# package.json: "engines": { "node": ">=20.0.0" }

# Step 5: Refactor dashboard-ui.ts to use blessed only
# (Alternative: Switch to ink/react or cli-ux)
```

**Breaking Changes to Address:**
1. Update Node.js version in CI/CD (18 → 20)
2. Review test files for vitest v4 API changes
3. Refactor dashboard UI without blessed-contrib widgets
4. Update documentation for Node 20+ requirement

**Option B: Stay on current stack (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

Accept risk and document in security policy. Suitable only if:
- Development strictly controlled (no public internet access)
- Dashboard UI feature not used in production
- Short-term project lifecycle

### Phase 3: Long-term (High Effort, Low Priority)
**Timeline:** 1-3 months

1. **Migrate to modern terminal UI framework**
   - Consider: ink + react, cli-ux, cliffy, oclif
   - Better maintenance, better security posture
   - More modern APIs and TypeScript support

2. **Implement automated security scanning**
   - Integrate npm audit into CI/CD
   - Use Snyk or GitHub Dependabot
   - Block PRs with high/critical vulnerabilities

3. **Dependency pinning strategy**
   - Lock direct dependencies
   - Use package-lock.json in version control
   - Quarterly dependency review process
