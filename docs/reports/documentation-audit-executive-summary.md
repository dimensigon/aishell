### 🟡 MEDIUM Priority

**3. Documentation Structure Issues**

## 🔍 Common Link Error Patterns

### 1. Placeholder Links (Most Common)
```markdown
[OWASP Guide](link)
[Security Best Practices](link)
[Related Doc](link1.md)
```
**Fix:** Replace with actual URLs or remove

### 2. Wrong Relative Paths
```markdown
# From docs/INDEX.md
[file](./guides/mcp-integration.md)  # ✅ Correct
[file](guides/mcp-integration.md)     # ❌ Missing ./
```
**Fix:** Ensure `./` or `../` prefix for relative paths

### 3. Missing Leading Slash for Absolute Paths
```markdown
# Absolute from repo root
[file](/docs/guides/user.md)          # ✅ Correct
[file](home/claude/AIShell/docs/...)  # ❌ Wrong
```
**Fix:** Use `/` prefix for absolute paths from repo root

### 4. Broken Anchor Links (154 instances)
```markdown
[Section](#section-1)
# But header is actually: ## Section One
# Anchor should be: #section-one
```
**Fix:** Match header text exactly (lowercase, dashes for spaces)

## 🛠️ Tools & Scripts

### Automated Link Validation
```bash
# Run full audit
python3 scripts/doc-audit.py

# View full report
cat docs/reports/documentation-audit-ga-release.md

# Find specific broken links
grep "File not found" docs/reports/documentation-audit-ga-release.md

# Count by error type
grep "File not found" docs/reports/documentation-audit-ga-release.md | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Quick Link Checker (Manual)
```bash
# Find all markdown links in a file
grep -o "\[.*\](.*)" file.md

# Find placeholder links
grep -r "\[.*\](link)" docs/

# Find broken relative paths (missing ./ or ../)
grep -r "\[.*\]([^./http]" docs/
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Link Validation is Critical:** 27% failure rate shows need for CI/CD link checking
2. **Organization Matters:** 98 files in root directory makes navigation difficult
3. **Orphaned Content:** Great content exists but is undiscoverable
4. **Placeholder Links:** Template-style links need systematic cleanup
5. **Anchor Validation:** Header changes break anchor links frequently

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Review this summary** with team
2. **Prioritize broken links** in high-traffic docs
3. **Create ticket/issue** for each priority 1 item
4. **Assign owners** for documentation areas
5. **Set up CI/CD** for automated link validation
6. **Schedule cleanup** for post-GA improvements
