## 🟡 CODER WORKER 3: Query Explainer Nested Loop Detection

### Assignment
- **Task:** Fix nested loop join detection in query explainer
- **Files:** `src/cli/feature-commands.ts` or query analyzer
- **Expected Impact:** ~5 tests
- **Status:** ⏳ PENDING VALIDATION

### Test Search

### Next Steps
- Search for query explainer tests: `find tests -name "*query*explainer*"`
- Run validation suite
- Report back with results

### Status
**🟡 AWAITING TEST EXECUTION**

## 🎯 Recommendations for Queen Coordinator

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Accept CODER WORKER 2's work** - All PostgreSQL tests passing
2. ⏳ **Validate CODER WORKER 3** - Need to locate and run query explainer tests
3. 🔥 **Assign Jest→Vitest conversion** - 50 tests blocked (CRITICAL)
4. 🔥 **Investigate backup failures** - 25 tests failing (HIGH)

### Resource Allocation
- CODER WORKER 2 is now available for new assignments
- Recommend assigning to Category 1 (Jest→Vitest) or Category 4 (Backup)
- CODER WORKER 3 awaiting validation results

### Path to 90%
```
Current:       80.8% ████████████████████░░░░
Jest Fix:     +50 = 84.5% ████████████████████░░░
Backup Fix:   +25 = 86.3% █████████████████████░░
MongoDB:      +30 = 88.5% ██████████████████████░
MySQL/Oracle: +20 = 90.0% ███████████████████████ ✅
```

**Estimated Time to 90%:** 6-8 hours with 3-4 active coders
