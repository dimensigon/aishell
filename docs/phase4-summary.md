## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Aggressive Timeline:** 2-day sprint forced focus and efficiency
2. **Daily Metrics:** Transparent progress tracking kept team aligned
3. **Parallel Agents:** Multiple specialized agents working simultaneously
4. **Quality Gates:** Zero regression policy prevented backsliding
5. **Documentation First:** Updated docs alongside code fixes

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Test File Passing Rate:** Only 68.3% of test files fully passing
2. **Communication:** More frequent sync-ups during rapid execution
3. **Automation:** More automated test grouping by priority
4. **Resource Planning:** Could have allocated more resources earlier

### Recommendations for Future Sprints

1. Start with aggressive timeline to force prioritization
2. Track both test count and test file metrics
3. Implement automated priority tagging for tests
4. Schedule daily standups during intense sprints
5. Maintain zero regression policy as non-negotiable
