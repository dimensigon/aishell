# Backup System Tutorial: Disaster Recovery in 60 Seconds

## Real-World Scenario

**Problem**: A developer accidentally ran `DELETE FROM users WHERE 1=1` on production at 2 PM. Your entire user table (3.2M users) is gone. Your last backup is from 24 hours ago. You're losing $10,000/minute.

**Solution**: AI-Shell's intelligent backup system with point-in-time recovery can restore your database to exactly 2 PM (before the disaster) in under 60 seconds.

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Differential Backups

Save storage with smart differential backups:

```bash
# Enable differential backups
aishell backup configure --strategy differential
```

**Storage Savings:**

```
📊 Backup Strategy Comparison
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Full Backups Only:
  Frequency: Daily
  Size per backup: 45.3 GB
  Monthly storage: 1,359 GB
  Cost: $30.82/month (AWS S3)

Smart Differential:
  Base: Weekly full backup (45.3 GB)
  Differential: Daily (avg 2.1 GB)
  Size per week: 45.3 + (6 × 2.1) = 57.9 GB
  Monthly storage: 231.6 GB (83% reduction!)
  Cost: $5.25/month (AWS S3)

💰 Savings: $25.57/month per database
```

### Pattern 2: Continuous Backup

For zero data loss:

```bash
# Enable continuous backup with WAL streaming
aishell backup configure --continuous --wal-streaming
```

**Configuration:**

```yaml
continuous_backup:
  enabled: true
  wal_streaming:
    enabled: true
    archive_timeout: 60s  # Archive WAL every 60s
    archive_command: 'aishell backup wal-archive %p'

  point_in_time_recovery:
    retention: 48h  # Can restore to any second in last 48h
    granularity: 1s  # Second-level precision

  storage:
    primary: s3://backups/wal/
    secondary: /var/lib/aishell/wal/
    compression: true
    encryption: true

Performance impact: <1% CPU, <5MB/s network
```

### Pattern 3: Selective Backup

Backup only what matters:

```bash
# Backup specific tables
aishell backup create --tables "users,orders,payments" --name "critical-tables"

# Exclude large tables
aishell backup create --exclude-tables "logs,analytics_events" --name "without-logs"

# Backup schema only
aishell backup create --schema-only --name "schema-snapshot"
```

### Pattern 4: Multi-Region Backup

For disaster recovery:

```bash
# Configure multi-region backups
aishell backup configure --multi-region
```

**Configuration:**

```yaml
multi_region:
  enabled: true
  regions:
    primary:
      provider: aws
      region: us-east-1
      bucket: backups-primary

    secondary:
      provider: aws
      region: us-west-2
      bucket: backups-secondary

    tertiary:
      provider: gcp
      region: us-central1
      bucket: backups-tertiary

  replication:
    mode: async  # Async replication for performance
    max_delay: 5m  # Replicate within 5 minutes

  failover:
    auto: true  # Automatic failover if primary unavailable
    health_check_interval: 60s
```

### Pattern 5: Backup Validation

Ensure backups actually work:

```bash
# Enable automatic backup testing
aishell backup configure --auto-test
```

**Testing Schedule:**

```yaml
backup_testing:
  enabled: true

  schedule:
    full_restore_test:
      frequency: weekly
      day: sunday
      time: "02:00"
      environment: staging

    partial_restore_test:
      frequency: daily
      time: "04:00"
      sample_size: 1%  # Test 1% of data

    integrity_check:
      frequency: hourly
      checks:
        - checksum_validation
        - file_structure
        - compressed_data_validity

  alerts:
    on_failure:
      channels: [slack, pagerduty]
      severity: critical
    on_success:
      channels: [slack]
      severity: info
      frequency: weekly  # Only alert weekly if all passing

  reporting:
    monthly_report: true
    recipients: [dba@company.com, devops@company.com]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. The 3-2-1 Rule

```bash
# 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite
aishell backup configure --strategy 3-2-1

Configuration:
  Copy 1: Production database (primary)
  Copy 2: Local backup server (fast recovery)
  Copy 3: AWS S3 us-east-1 (cloud)
  Copy 4: AWS S3 us-west-2 (different region)

Media:
  Type 1: Local disk (SSD)
  Type 2: Cloud object storage (S3)

Offsite:
  us-west-2 (different region from production)
```

### 2. Test Your Backups

```bash
# The only backup that matters is one you've tested
aishell backup test --latest

# Automate testing
aishell backup configure --auto-test-weekly
```

### 3. Monitor Backup Health

```bash
# Ensure backups are running
aishell backup health

# Set up alerts for backup failures
aishell backup alert configure --on-failure critical
```

### 4. Document Recovery Procedures

```bash
# Generate runbook
aishell backup runbook > recovery-runbook.md

# Practice recovery
aishell backup drill --scenario "production-database-loss"
```

### 5. Encrypt Everything

```bash
# Enable encryption for backups
aishell backup configure --encryption aes-256

# Manage keys securely
aishell backup keys rotate --schedule monthly
```

---

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Backups Too Slow

**Problem:** Backups taking 6+ hours, impacting performance

**Solution:**

```bash
# Use parallel backup
aishell backup create --parallel --workers 8

# Or use differential backups
aishell backup configure --strategy differential

# Backup to faster storage
aishell backup configure --storage-class PERFORMANCE
```

### Pitfall 2: Not Testing Restores

**Problem:** Backup works but restore fails

**Solution:**

```bash
# Automatic restore testing
aishell backup test --schedule weekly

# Practice disaster recovery
aishell backup drill
```

### Pitfall 3: No Point-in-Time Recovery

**Problem:** Can only restore to backup time, not exact incident point

**Solution:**

```bash
# Enable WAL archiving
aishell backup configure --wal-archiving --retention 48h

# Now you can restore to any second in last 48 hours
```

### Pitfall 4: Backups Consuming Too Much Storage

**Problem:** Backup costs spiraling out of control

**Solution:**

```bash
# Analyze backup usage
aishell backup analyze-storage

# Optimize retention
aishell backup configure --retention-policy "
  hourly: 48h
  daily: 7d
  weekly: 30d
  monthly: 365d
"

# Enable compression
aishell backup configure --compression zstd:3
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Restore failing with checksum mismatch"

```bash
# Verify backup integrity
aishell backup verify --backup-id abc123

# Try alternative backup location
aishell backup restore --backup-id abc123 --location secondary

# If all backups corrupted, use emergency recovery
aishell backup emergency-recover
```

### Issue 2: "Backup taking too long"

```bash
# Analyze bottleneck
aishell backup diagnose --last-backup

# Optimize backup process
aishell backup optimize --target-duration 30m
```

### Issue 3: "Out of disk space during restore"

```bash
# Restore to alternative location
aishell backup restore --target /mnt/large-disk/

# Or restore only essential tables
aishell backup restore --tables "users,orders" --skip-indexes
```
