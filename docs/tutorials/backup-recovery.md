# Expected: ‚úì Backup features enabled

# Verify backup permissions
ai-shell check-permissions --feature backup
# Expected: ‚úì Read access, ‚úì Backup privileges

# Check available storage
ai-shell check-disk-space --backup-dir /backup
# Expected: Show available space

# Test backup functionality
ai-shell backup test --dry-run
# Expected: ‚úì Backup test successful (no actual backup created)
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Your First Manual Backup

Let's create your first database backup.

```bash
# Create simple backup
ai-shell backup create

# AI-Shell creates backup with automatic naming
# üîÑ Creating backup...
#
# Backup Details:
#   Database: mydb
#   Type: Full
#   Started: 2025-10-28 14:30:00
#
# Progress:
#   ‚úì Analyzing database (234MB)
#   ‚úì Creating snapshot
#   ‚úì Compressing (234MB ‚Üí 67MB, 71% reduction)
#   ‚úì Calculating checksum
#   ‚úì Verifying integrity
#
# ‚úì Backup completed successfully
#
# Backup Info:
#   Filename: mydb-20251028-143000.backup
#   Location: /backup/mydb-20251028-143000.backup
#   Size: 67MB (compressed from 234MB)
#   Duration: 12 seconds
#   Checksum: sha256:8f7a3d9c...

# Create backup with custom name
ai-shell backup create --name "before-migration"

# Create backup to specific location
ai-shell backup create --output /backups/important/
```

---

### Step 2: Understanding Backup Types

AI-Shell supports multiple backup types for different scenarios.

#### Full Backup
```bash
# Complete database backup (default)
ai-shell backup create --type full

# Best for:
# - Initial backups
# - Weekly/monthly archives
# - Pre-migration snapshots
#
# Pros: Complete standalone backup
# Cons: Largest size, slowest
```

#### Incremental Backup
```bash
# Only backup changes since last backup
ai-shell backup create --type incremental

# Best for:
# - Frequent backups (hourly, daily)
# - Large databases with small daily changes
# - Minimizing backup time and storage
#
# Pros: Fast, small size
# Cons: Requires full backup + all incrementals to restore
#
# Example sequence:
# Sunday: Full backup (234MB)
# Monday: Incremental (12MB - only Monday changes)
# Tuesday: Incremental (8MB - only Tuesday changes)
# Wednesday: Incremental (15MB - only Wednesday changes)
#
# To restore Wednesday: Need Sunday full + Mon + Tue + Wed incrementals
```

#### Differential Backup
```bash
# Backup all changes since last full backup
ai-shell backup create --type differential

# Best for:
# - Daily backups
# - Balance between full and incremental
#
# Pros: Faster restore than incremental (only need full + latest differential)
# Cons: Larger than incremental
#
# Example sequence:
# Sunday: Full backup (234MB)
# Monday: Differential (12MB - changes since Sunday)
# Tuesday: Differential (23MB - all changes since Sunday)
# Wednesday: Differential (34MB - all changes since Sunday)
#
# To restore Wednesday: Only need Sunday full + Wednesday differential
```

#### Schema-Only Backup
```bash
# Backup only database structure (no data)
ai-shell backup create --type schema-only

# Best for:
# - Version control of database structure
# - Quick structure snapshots
# - Migration planning
#
# Pros: Very fast, tiny size
# Cons: No data included
```

---

### Step 3: Automated Backup Scheduling

Set up automatic backups to run without manual intervention.

```bash
# Schedule daily backups at 2 AM
ai-shell backup schedule --interval daily --time "02:00"

# Output:
# ‚úì Backup schedule created
#
# Schedule Details:
#   Frequency: Daily at 02:00
#   Type: Full (Sunday), Incremental (Mon-Sat)
#   Retention: 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly
#   Location: /backup
#   Notifications: enabled
#
# Next backup: 2025-10-29 02:00:00

# Schedule with custom pattern
ai-shell backup schedule \
  --cron "0 2 * * *" \          # Daily at 2 AM
  --type full \
  --retain-days 30 \
  --retain-weeks 12 \
  --retain-months 12

# Multiple backup schedules
ai-shell backup schedule --name hourly-incremental \
  --interval hourly \
  --type incremental

ai-shell backup schedule --name weekly-full \
  --interval weekly \
  --day sunday \
  --time "01:00" \
  --type full

# View scheduled backups
ai-shell backup schedules list

# Output:
# üìÖ Backup Schedules
#
# 1. daily-backup (active)
#    Frequency: Daily at 02:00
#    Type: Full (Sunday), Incremental (Mon-Sat)
#    Next run: 2025-10-29 02:00:00
#
# 2. hourly-incremental (active)
#    Frequency: Hourly
#    Type: Incremental
#    Next run: 2025-10-28 15:00:00
#
# 3. weekly-full (active)
#    Frequency: Weekly (Sunday) at 01:00
#    Type: Full
#    Next run: 2025-11-03 01:00:00
```

### Step 4: Backup Management and Organization

Organize and manage your backup files effectively.

```bash
# List all backups
ai-shell backup list

# Output:
# üì¶ Database Backups
#
# Full Backups:

# 2. mydb-20251021-020000.backup
#    Date: 2025-10-21 02:00:00
#    Size: 65MB
#    Type: Full
#    Status: ‚úì Verified
#
# Incremental Backups (last 7 days):
# - 7 incremental backups (89MB total)
#
# Total: 9 backups, 156MB

# Filter backups
ai-shell backup list --type full
ai-shell backup list --after "2025-10-01"
ai-shell backup list --status verified

# Get backup details
ai-shell backup info mydb-20251028-020000.backup

### Step 5: Backup Retention Policies

Automatically manage backup lifecycle to save storage.

```bash
# Configure retention policy
ai-shell backup retention set \
  --keep-daily 7 \      # Keep 7 daily backups
  --keep-weekly 4 \     # Keep 4 weekly backups
  --keep-monthly 12 \   # Keep 12 monthly backups
  --keep-yearly 3       # Keep 3 yearly backups

# View retention policy
ai-shell backup retention show

# Output:
# üìä Backup Retention Policy
#
# Daily Backups: Keep last 7 (1 week)
# Weekly Backups: Keep last 4 (1 month)
# Monthly Backups: Keep last 12 (1 year)
# Yearly Backups: Keep last 3 (3 years)
#
# Current Status:
#   Daily: 7/7 (full)
#   Weekly: 4/4 (full)
#   Monthly: 8/12 (67%)
#   Yearly: 1/3 (33%)
#
# Next Cleanup: 2025-10-29 03:00:00
# Space to be freed: ~45MB

# Apply retention policy immediately
ai-shell backup retention apply

# Output:
# üóëÔ∏è Applying retention policy...
#
# Backups to remove:
#   ‚ùå mydb-20250927-020000.backup (older than 7 days)
#   ‚ùå mydb-20250920-020000.backup (superseded by weekly)
#   ... (5 more)
#
# Total to remove: 7 backups (234MB)
# Confirm deletion? [y/N]: y
#
# ‚úì 7 backups deleted
# ‚úì 234MB freed
```

---

### Step 6: Backup Validation and Verification

Ensure your backups are valid and restorable.

```bash
# Verify backup integrity
ai-shell backup verify mydb-20251028-020000.backup

# Output:
# üîç Verifying backup integrity...
#
# Tests:
#   ‚úì File exists and is readable

### Step 7: Restoring from Backups

Recover your database from backup files.

```bash
# Simple restore (overwrites current database)
ai-shell backup restore mydb-20251028-020000.backup

# Output:
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will overwrite database 'mydb'
# Current database will be backed up first for safety.
#
# Continue? [y/N]: y
#
# üîÑ Restoring database...
#

ai-shell backup restore mydb-20251028-020000.backup \
  --target postgres://other-host:5432/mydb \
  --no-downtime
```

---

### Step 8: Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

Restore your database to any specific moment in time.

```bash
# Enable continuous backup (required for PITR)
ai-shell backup pitr enable

# Output:
# üîÑ Enabling Point-in-Time Recovery...
#
# Configuration:
#   ‚úì WAL archiving enabled
#   ‚úì Archive directory: /backup/wal-archive
#   ‚úì Continuous backup mode activated
#
# PITR is now active. You can restore to any point in time.
# First recovery point: 2025-10-28 14:30:00

# Check PITR status
ai-shell backup pitr status

# Output:
# üìä Point-in-Time Recovery Status
#
# Status: ‚úì Active
# First recovery point: 2025-10-28 14:30:00

#   Oldest: 2025-10-28 14:30:00
#   Newest: 2025-10-28 14:45:23

# Restore to specific point in time
ai-shell backup pitr restore --point-in-time "2025-10-28 14:35:00"

# Output:
# üîÑ Point-in-Time Recovery
#
# Target time: 2025-10-28 14:35:00
# Current time: 2025-10-28 14:45:23
# Recovery window: 10 minutes 23 seconds back
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  This will restore database to 2025-10-28 14:35:00
# All changes after that point will be lost.
#
# Continue? [y/N]: y
#
# Recovery Progress:
#   ‚úì Finding base backup (2025-10-28 14:30:00)
#   ‚úì Restoring base backup
#   ‚úì Applying WAL archives (5 archives)
#   ‚úì Replaying transactions up to 14:35:00
#   ‚úì Stopping at target point
#   ‚úì Verifying consistency
#
# ‚úì Point-in-Time recovery successful

#   Target time: 14:35:00 ‚Üê database is here now
#   Current time: 14:45:23

# Restore to "5 minutes ago"
ai-shell backup pitr restore --relative "5 minutes ago"

# Restore to before specific event
ai-shell backup pitr restore --before-transaction <transaction-id>
```

---

### Step 9: Cross-Database Backup Coordination

Coordinate backups across multiple databases in federation.

```bash
# Backup multiple databases together
ai-shell backup create --all-databases

# Output:
# üîÑ Creating coordinated backup...
#
# Databases:
#   - postgres-main (PostgreSQL)
#   - mongodb-products (MongoDB)
#   - redis-cache (Redis)
#
# Strategy: Coordinated snapshot at 14:50:00
#
# Progress:
#   ‚úì Taking snapshot of postgres-main
#   ‚úì Taking snapshot of mongodb-products
#   ‚úì Saving redis snapshot
#   ‚úì Creating manifest
#   ‚úì Verifying consistency
#
# ‚úì Coordinated backup completed
#
# Backup Set: multi-db-20251028-145000
# Files:
#   - postgres-main.backup (67MB)
#   - mongodb-products.archive (45MB)
#   - redis-cache.rdb (12MB)
#   - manifest.json (4KB)
# Total size: 124MB
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Important: This backup set must be restored together
#              to maintain data consistency across databases.

# Schedule coordinated backups
ai-shell backup schedule \
  --all-databases \
  --interval daily \
  --time "02:00" \
  --coordinated

# Restore coordinated backup
ai-shell backup restore multi-db-20251028-145000 --all
```

### Step 10: Disaster Recovery Planning

Prepare for worst-case scenarios with disaster recovery setup.

```bash
# Create disaster recovery plan
ai-shell backup dr-plan create

# Output:
# üîß Creating Disaster Recovery Plan...
#
# Analyzing environment...
#   Database: mydb (PostgreSQL)
#   Size: 234MB
#   Daily change rate: ~5%
#   Critical: Yes
#
# Recommended DR Plan:
#
# 1. Backup Schedule:
#    - Full backup: Daily at 02:00
#    - Incremental: Every 4 hours
#    - PITR: Enabled (continuous)
#
# 2. Backup Locations:
#    - Primary: Local (/backup)
#    - Secondary: S3 (s3://backups/mydb)
#    - Tertiary: Google Cloud (gs://dr-backups/mydb)
#
# 3. Retention:
#    - Primary: 7 days
#    - Secondary: 30 days
#    - Tertiary: 1 year
#
# 4. Recovery Objectives:
#    - RPO (Recovery Point): 4 hours
#    - RTO (Recovery Time): 1 hour
#
# 5. Testing:
#    - Monthly DR drill
#    - Quarterly full recovery test
#
# Apply this plan? [y/N]: y

# Configure off-site backup
ai-shell backup remote add s3://my-backups/mydb \
  --access-key $AWS_ACCESS_KEY \
  --secret-key $AWS_SECRET_KEY \
  --region us-east-1

# Enable automatic remote sync
ai-shell backup remote sync enable \
  --destination s3://my-backups/mydb \
  --schedule "after-each-backup"

# Test disaster recovery
ai-shell backup dr-test

# Output:
# üß™ Disaster Recovery Test
#
# Scenario: Complete database loss
#
# Test Steps:
#   1. Simulating database failure...
#   2. Identifying latest valid backup...
#   3. Retrieving from remote (S3)...
#   4. Restoring to test environment...
#   5. Verifying data integrity...
#   6. Testing application connectivity...
#   7. Measuring recovery time...
#
# Results:
#   ‚úì Recovery successful
#   ‚úì Data integrity verified
#   ‚úì Application functional
#
# Metrics:
#   Recovery Point: 2025-10-28 02:00:00 (current time: 14:50:00)
#   Data Loss: 12 hours 50 minutes
#   Recovery Time: 18 minutes 34 seconds
#
# Analysis:
#   ‚úì RPO met (target: 4 hours, actual: 12h 50m) ‚ö†Ô∏è  exceeds target
#   ‚úì RTO met (target: 1 hour, actual: 18m 34s)
#
# Recommendation:
#   ‚ö° Increase incremental backup frequency to meet RPO
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Issue 1: Backup Fails with Insufficient Space

**Problem:** Not enough disk space to create backup.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check available space
ai-shell check-disk-space --backup-dir /backup

# Clean up old backups
ai-shell backup cleanup --apply-retention

# Use compression
ai-shell backup create --compress high

# Use remote storage
ai-shell backup create --remote s3://backups/

# Backup to different location
ai-shell backup create --output /mnt/large-drive/backup/
```

---

### Issue 2: Restore Takes Too Long

**Problem:** Database restore is taking hours.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use parallel restore
ai-shell backup restore mydb.backup --parallel 4

# Restore without indexes first (rebuild after)
ai-shell backup restore mydb.backup --defer-indexes

# Restore only essential tables first
ai-shell backup restore mydb.backup \
  --tables users,orders,products \
  --remainder-async

# Use faster storage for restore
ai-shell backup restore mydb.backup \
  --temp-tablespace /fast-ssd/restore-temp/
```

---

### Issue 3: Backup Verification Fails

**Problem:** Backup verification reports corruption.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Get detailed verification report
ai-shell backup verify mydb.backup --verbose

# Check if backup file is damaged
ai-shell backup integrity-check mydb.backup

# If corrupted, restore from previous backup
ai-shell backup list --verified-only

# Enable backup redundancy (multiple copies)
ai-shell config set backup.redundancy 2

# Test backup immediately after creation
ai-shell config set backup.verify-after-create true
```

---

### Issue 4: PITR Not Working

**Problem:** Point-in-time recovery fails or is unavailable.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check PITR status
ai-shell backup pitr status

# Verify WAL archiving is working
ai-shell backup pitr check-wal-archiving

# Check for WAL archive gaps
ai-shell backup pitr check-coverage

# If gaps found, re-enable PITR
ai-shell backup pitr repair

# Increase WAL retention
ai-shell config set pitr.wal-retention 7d
```

---

### Issue 5: Remote Backup Sync Failing

**Problem:** Backups not uploading to remote storage (S3, GCS).

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Test remote connection
ai-shell backup remote test s3://backups/

# Check credentials
ai-shell backup remote auth-check

# View sync logs
ai-shell backup remote logs

# Retry failed syncs
ai-shell backup remote retry-failed

# Increase timeout for large backups
ai-shell config set backup.remote.timeout 3600

# Use resumable uploads
ai-shell config set backup.remote.resumable true
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Follow the 3-2-1 Rule

```bash
# 3 copies of data
# - Original database
# - Local backup
# - Remote backup

# 2 different media types
# - Disk (local)
# - Cloud (S3/GCS)

# 1 copy off-site
# - Remote storage in different region

ai-shell backup strategy 3-2-1 --auto-configure
```

### 2. Test Restores Regularly

```bash
# Schedule monthly restore tests
ai-shell backup test-restore-schedule monthly

# Verify you can actually restore, not just that backups exist
# "Untested backups are not backups"
```

### 3. Monitor Backup Health

```bash
# Set up alerts
ai-shell alerts add backup-failed
ai-shell alerts add backup-verification-failed
ai-shell alerts add backup-storage-low

# Regular health checks
ai-shell backup health-check --schedule daily
```

### 4. Encrypt Sensitive Data

```bash
# Always encrypt backups containing sensitive data
ai-shell config set backup.encryption enabled
ai-shell config set backup.encryption-key-id $KEY_ID
```

### 5. Document Recovery Procedures

```bash
# Generate recovery runbook
ai-shell backup runbook generate

# Keep runbook accessible (not in same system as backups!)
```

### 6. Separate Backup Storage

```bash
# Never store backups on same disk/server as database
# Use separate physical storage
# Use different cloud account/region
```
