## Overview

AI-Shell's cognitive system consists of three main components:

### 1. Memory System
- **Short-term Memory**: Recent commands and operations
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge and patterns
- **Semantic Search**: Natural language query of history
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains operational context

### 2. Learning Engine
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring workflows
- **Feedback Loop**: Improves from user corrections
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Learns optimal query patterns
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Shares learning across databases

### 3. Intelligence Layer
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Recommendations based on current task
- **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipates next actions
- **Problem Solving**: Recalls solutions to similar issues
- **Continuous Improvement**: Gets smarter over time

#   → ai-shell insights suggest
#   → ai-shell learn from feedback
```

### Quick Start: First Cognitive Query

```bash
# Execute a command (it gets stored automatically)
ai-shell query "show active users"

# Later, recall how you did it
ai-shell memory recall "how to find active users"

# Output:
# 🧠 Memory Recall
#
# Found 3 relevant entries:
#
# 1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (98% match)
#    Date: 2025-10-28 14:23:45
#    Command: ai-shell query "show active users"
#    SQL: SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
#    Result: 1,234 rows (23ms)
#    Notes: Fast, uses index on status column
#
# 2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (87% match)
#    Date: 2025-10-27 10:15:30
#    Command: ai-shell query "list all active accounts"
#    SQL: SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active' AND deleted_at IS NULL
#    Result: 1,189 rows (19ms)
#    Notes: Excludes soft-deleted users
#
# 3. ⭐⭐⭐ (75% match)

# Search by date
ai-shell memory recall "user management" --since "last week"
```

**Advanced Search:**

```bash
# Combine multiple criteria
ai-shell memory recall \
  "database optimization" \
  --database production \
  --since "2025-10-01" \
  --successful-only \
  --min-confidence 80%

# Based on your history with similar queries:
#
# 1. Column Selection Optimization (92% confidence)
#    You typically don't need all columns
#    Common pattern: id, customer_id, total, status
#
#    Suggested query:
#      SELECT id, customer_id, total, status, created_at
#      FROM orders
#      WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
#
#    Expected impact: 3.2x faster
#
# 2. Index Usage (89% confidence)
#    Query uses created_at column
#    Index exists: idx_orders_created_at ✓
#    Status: Will be used automatically
#
# 3. Common Follow-up Actions (87% confidence)
#    After this query, you usually:
#      a) Group by customer (12 times)
#      b) Calculate totals (9 times)
#      c) Export to CSV (8 times)
#
#    Pre-build these now? [y/N]
#
# 4. Caching Opportunity (85% confidence)
#    You run this query 3-4 times per week
#    Cache the result for 1 hour?
#    Savings: ~30 seconds per week

### Use Case 4: Learn from Performance Incident

**Scenario:** Resolved a performance incident and want to remember the solution

```bash
# After resolving the incident, document it
ai-shell memory record incident \
  --problem "Database CPU spike to 98%" \
  --cause "Missing index on new orders.tracking_number column" \
  --solution "CREATE INDEX idx_orders_tracking ON orders(tracking_number)" \
  --impact "CPU dropped to 35%, queries 12x faster" \
  --tags "performance,incident,indexing"

# AI-Shell stores this with context:
# ✓ Incident recorded
# ✓ Added to knowledge base
# ✓ Similar incidents: 0 (new pattern)
# ✓ Alert created: Monitor for similar issues
#
# AI-Shell will now:
#   - Watch for similar patterns
#   - Suggest this solution for similar issues
#   - Alert you if this happens again
#   - Share with team (if configured)

# Later, if a similar issue occurs
ai-shell diagnose "high CPU usage"

# AI-Shell recalls:
# 🔍 Diagnostic Results
#
# Similar to known issue:
#   "Database CPU spike to 98%" (2025-10-28)
#   Confidence: 87%
#
# Known Solution:
#   1. Check for missing indexes on new columns
#   2. Review recent schema changes
#   3. Common fix: Add appropriate indexes
#
# Run diagnostic check? [y/N]: y
#
# Checking...
#   ✓ Identified: New column 'shipment_id' added yesterday
#   ✓ No index on shipment_id
#   ✓ 1,234 queries using this column
#   ⚠️  Average query time: 2,340ms
#
# Likely cause: Missing index on orders.shipment_id
#
# Apply known solution? [y/N]: y
#
# Creating index...
#   ✓ CREATE INDEX idx_orders_shipment ON orders(shipment_id)
#   ✓ CPU usage: 98% → 32%
#   ✓ Query time: 2,340ms → 24ms (97.5x faster)
#
# ✅ Issue resolved using learned solution!
```

#
# Your team starts each day with a health check.
# Let's try it:
#
# Type: ai-shell health-check
#
# [User executes command]
#
# Great! This checks:
#   - Database connectivity
#   - Recent errors
#   - Performance metrics
#   - Pending alerts
#
# Your team runs this 94% of mornings.
# Would you like to automate it? [y/N]

```bash
# Find similar queries
ai-shell memory similar "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?"

# Output:
# 🔍 Similar Queries (Vector Search)
#
# Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?
#
# Top 5 Similar Queries:
#
# 1. Similarity: 0.95 (95%)
#    SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1

#    Performance: 2ms (with index)
#
# 2. Similarity: 0.89 (89%)
#    SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE email LIKE ?
#    Difference: Specific columns + LIKE operator
#    Performance: 12ms
#
# 3. Similarity: 0.87 (87%)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Memory Search Returns No Results

**Symptoms:**
```
ai-shell memory recall "..."
Output: No matching entries found
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check memory status
ai-shell memory status

# Verify entries exist
ai-shell memory list --recent 10

# Rebuild vector index
ai-shell memory rebuild-index

# Adjust search sensitivity
ai-shell config set memory.searchThreshold 0.5  # Lower = more results

# Try broader search terms
ai-shell memory recall "performance" --broad
```

### Issue 2: Suggestions Not Relevant

**Symptoms:**
- AI-Shell suggests irrelevant actions
- Low confidence scores

**Solution:**

```bash
# Provide feedback
ai-shell feedback not-relevant --suggestion-id sugg_123

# Check learning configuration
ai-shell learn config --show

# Increase confidence threshold
ai-shell config set learn.confidence_threshold 0.85

# Retrain on recent data
ai-shell learn train --recent 30days

# Reset and rebuild patterns
ai-shell learn reset
ai-shell learn rebuild
```

### Issue 3: Slow Memory Searches

**Symptoms:**
- Memory searches take >5 seconds
- Dashboard slow to load

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check memory database size
ai-shell memory status

# Optimize memory database
ai-shell memory optimize

# Archive old entries
ai-shell memory archive --older-than 6months

# Rebuild index
ai-shell memory rebuild-index

# Adjust cache size
ai-shell config set memory.cacheSize 10000
```

### Issue 4: Pattern Detection Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- AI-Shell doesn't detect obvious patterns
- No workflow suggestions

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check minimum occurrence threshold
ai-shell config get learn.minPatternOccurrences

# Lower threshold for more sensitive detection
ai-shell config set learn.minPatternOccurrences 2

# Manually trigger pattern analysis
ai-shell learn analyze --force

# Check audit log completeness
ai-shell audit-log status

# Enable verbose pattern logging
ai-shell config set learn.verboseLogging true
```
