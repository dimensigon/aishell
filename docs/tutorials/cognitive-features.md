#
# AI-Shell will now:
#   - Watch for similar patterns
#   - Suggest this solution for similar issues
#   - Alert you if this happens again
#   - Share with team (if configured)

# Later, if a similar issue occurs
ai-shell diagnose "high CPU usage"

# AI-Shell recalls:
# 🔍 Diagnostic Results
#
# Similar to known issue:
#   "Database CPU spike to 98%" (2025-10-28)
#   Confidence: 87%
#
# Known Solution:
#   1. Check for missing indexes on new columns
#   2. Review recent schema changes
#   3. Common fix: Add appropriate indexes
#
# Run diagnostic check? [y/N]: y
#
# Checking...
#   ✓ Identified: New column 'shipment_id' added yesterday
#   ✓ No index on shipment_id
#   ✓ 1,234 queries using this column
#   ⚠️  Average query time: 2,340ms
#
# Likely cause: Missing index on orders.shipment_id
#
# Apply known solution? [y/N]: y
#
# Creating index...
#   ✓ CREATE INDEX idx_orders_shipment ON orders(shipment_id)
#   ✓ CPU usage: 98% → 32%

1. **Regular Index Maintenance**
   ```bash
   # Rebuild indexes weekly for optimal performance
   ai-shell memory rebuild-index --optimize

   # Expected improvement: 40-60% faster searches
   ```

2. **Archive Old Data**
   ```bash
   # Archive entries older than 6 months to improve search speed
   ai-shell memory archive --older-than 6months --to backup/

   # Reduces search space, speeds up queries by 2-3x
   ```

3. **Configure Cache Size**
   ```bash
   # Increase cache for faster repeated searches
   ai-shell config set memory.cacheSize 10000  # Default: 5000
   ai-shell config set memory.vectorCacheSize 5000  # For embeddings
   ```

4. **Batch Operations**
   ```bash
   # Import/export in batches for large knowledge bases
   ai-shell learn import --batch-size 1000 --parallel 4
   ```

### Learning Engine Optimization

1. **Adjust Pattern Detection Sensitivity**
   ```bash
   # Balance between speed and accuracy
   ai-shell config set learn.sensitivity medium  # low/medium/high
   ai-shell config set learn.minPatternOccurrences 3  # Require 3+ occurrences
   ```

2. **Selective Learning**
   ```bash
   # Focus learning on specific areas
   ai-shell learn enable query-optimization
   ai-shell learn disable workflow-detection  # If not needed
   ```

3. **Schedule Heavy Operations**
   ```bash
   # Run intensive training during off-hours
   ai-shell learn train --schedule "daily 2am" --async
   ```

### Memory Footprint Optimization

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

1. **Sensitive Data Redaction**
   ```bash
   # Enable automatic PII redaction
   ai-shell config set privacy.redactSensitiveData true

   # Configure what to redact
   ai-shell config set privacy.redactPatterns "email,ssn,phone,credit_card"
   ```

2. **Query Anonymization**
   ```yaml
   # ~/.ai-shell/privacy/config.yaml
   privacy:
     anonymizeQueries: true
     anonymizeResults: true
     redactColumns: ["password", "token", "secret"]
     maskingChar: "***"
   ```

3. **Audit Logging**
   ```bash
   # Enable comprehensive audit logs
   ai-shell config set audit.logMemoryAccess true
   ai-shell config set audit.logPatternAccess true

   # Review access logs
   ai-shell audit-log memory --last 7days
   ```

### Team Collaboration Security

1. **Knowledge Base Access Control**
   ```bash
   # Set up role-based access
   ai-shell learn permissions set \
     --role admin --access full \
     --role developer --access read-write \
     --role viewer --access read

   # Encrypt shared knowledge base
   ai-shell learn export --encrypt --password-file .kb-password
   ```

2. **Secure Sync**
   ```yaml
   # ~/.ai-shell/collaboration/config.yaml
   security:
     encryption: true
     tlsVersion: "1.3"
     verifyPeers: true
     requireAuthentication: true
   ```

### API Key Security

1. **Anthropic API Key Protection**
   ```bash
   # Store API key securely
   ai-shell config set claude.apiKey --from-env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

   # Never log API keys
   ai-shell config set logging.redactApiKeys true

   # Rotate keys regularly
   ai-shell config rotate-key --service claude
   ```

2. **Key Usage Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Monitor API usage for anomalies
   ai-shell monitor api-usage --alert-on-anomaly

   # Set usage limits
   ai-shell config set claude.maxTokensPerDay 1000000
   ```

### Memory Isolation

```bash
# Isolate memory by environment
ai-shell memory init --isolation-mode strict

# Separate production and development learning
ai-shell config set memory.isolateByDatabase true
ai-shell config set memory.isolateByEnvironment true
```

### Backup Security

```bash
# Encrypted backups
ai-shell memory backup --encrypt --output backup.encrypted.tar.gz

# Secure backup location
ai-shell config set backup.location "s3://secure-bucket/ai-shell-backups/"
ai-shell config set backup.encryption aes-256-gcm
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Overfitting to Recent Patterns

**Problem:** AI-Shell learns too much from recent activity, ignoring established patterns.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Balance recent vs historical learning
ai-shell config set learn.recentWeight 0.3  # 30% recent, 70% historical

# Prevent over-learning from anomalies
ai-shell config set learn.anomalyThreshold 3.0  # 3 std deviations
```

### Pitfall 2: Memory Bloat

**Problem:** Memory database grows too large, slowing down searches.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Set retention policies
ai-shell config set memory.retentionDays 180  # Keep 6 months

# Automatic cleanup
ai-shell memory cleanup --remove-duplicates --compress-old

# Monitor size
ai-shell memory status | grep "Storage"
```

### Pitfall 3: Context Misinterpretation

**Problem:** AI-Shell misunderstands context, provides irrelevant suggestions.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Provide explicit context
ai-shell query "..." --context "performance optimization"

# Correct misunderstandings
ai-shell feedback correct "I meant X not Y"

# Reset context if needed
ai-shell context clear
```

### Pitfall 4: Insufficient Training Data

**Problem:** Pattern detection fails due to limited history.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Import historical data
ai-shell memory import --from audit-logs.json --period "last year"

# Lower detection threshold temporarily
ai-shell config set learn.minPatternOccurrences 2

# Manual pattern creation
ai-shell learn pattern create "morning-check" --steps "..."
```

### Pitfall 5: Conflicting Team Patterns

**Problem:** Team members have different workflows, causing confusing suggestions.

**Solution:**
```bash
# User-specific learning
ai-shell config set learn.personalizedLearning true

# Separate team and personal patterns
ai-shell learn partition --personal-patterns separate

# Voting on shared patterns
ai-shell learn shared --voting-threshold 60%  # 60% team agreement
```

### Pitfall 6: Feedback Loop Amplification

**Problem:** Small optimization mistake gets amplified through repeated learning.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Enable conservative learning
ai-shell config set learn.conservativeMode true

# Require human approval for major changes
ai-shell config set learn.requireApproval "optimization,schema_change"

# Monitor learning impact
ai-shell learn impact --alert-on-regression
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Scale Gradually

```bash
# Begin with basic memory tracking
ai-shell memory init --mode simple

# Enable features incrementally
ai-shell learn enable query-optimization  # Start here
# Wait 1-2 weeks, then:
ai-shell learn enable workflow-detection
# Another week:
ai-shell learn enable error-recovery
```

### 2. Regular Feedback

```bash
# Make feedback a habit
ai-shell config set feedback.promptFrequency daily
ai-shell config set feedback.quickFeedback true  # 👍/👎 buttons

# Schedule feedback reviews
ai-shell feedback review --weekly
```

### 3. Continuous Monitoring

```bash
# Set up monitoring dashboard
ai-shell dashboard create cognitive-health \
  --metrics "search-latency,pattern-accuracy,suggestion-quality" \
  --refresh 5m

# Alert on degradation
ai-shell alerts create "pattern-accuracy" \
  --condition "< 85%" \
  --action "email:team@example.com"
```

### 4. Team Collaboration

```bash
# Weekly knowledge sync
ai-shell learn sync --team devops --schedule weekly

# Share successful patterns
ai-shell learn share pattern "perf-opt-workflow" \
  --with team \
  --include-metrics

# Team review sessions
ai-shell learn review --team --period weekly
```

### 5. Version Control for Patterns

```bash
# Track pattern changes
ai-shell learn export --output patterns-v$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Git integration
cd ~/.ai-shell/learning/
git init
git add patterns/
git commit -m "Weekly pattern snapshot"

# Rollback if needed
ai-shell learn import --from patterns-v20251015.json
```

### 6. Documentation

```bash
# Document important patterns
ai-shell learn annotate pattern "critical-incident-response" \
  --notes "Use this for production incidents" \
  --owner "devops-team" \
  --reviewDate "quarterly"

# Generate knowledge base documentation
ai-shell learn docs generate --output kb/
```

### 7. Performance Baselines

```bash
# Establish baselines before enabling learning
ai-shell benchmark create baseline \
  --queries "common-queries.sql" \
  --iterations 100

# Compare after learning enabled
ai-shell benchmark compare baseline vs current
```

### 8. Privacy-First Approach

```yaml
# ~/.ai-shell/best-practices.yaml
privacy:
  default_redaction: true
  audit_all_access: true
  encryption_at_rest: true
  minimize_data_collection: true

learning:
  collect_only_necessary: true
  anonymize_before_sharing: true
  user_consent_required: true

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Memory Search Returns No Results

**Symptoms:**
```
ai-shell memory recall "..."
Output: No matching entries found
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check memory status
ai-shell memory status

# Verify entries exist
ai-shell memory list --recent 10

# Rebuild vector index
ai-shell memory rebuild-index

# Adjust search sensitivity
ai-shell config set memory.searchThreshold 0.5  # Lower = more results

# Try broader search terms
ai-shell memory recall "performance" --broad
```

### Issue 2: Suggestions Not Relevant

**Symptoms:**
- AI-Shell suggests irrelevant actions
- Low confidence scores

**Solution:**

```bash
# Provide feedback
ai-shell feedback not-relevant --suggestion-id sugg_123

# Check learning configuration
ai-shell learn config --show

# Increase confidence threshold
ai-shell config set learn.confidence_threshold 0.85

# Retrain on recent data
ai-shell learn train --recent 30days

# Reset and rebuild patterns
ai-shell learn reset
ai-shell learn rebuild
```

### Issue 3: Slow Memory Searches

**Symptoms:**
- Memory searches take >5 seconds
- Dashboard slow to load

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check memory database size
ai-shell memory status

# Optimize memory database
ai-shell memory optimize

# Archive old entries
ai-shell memory archive --older-than 6months

# Rebuild index
ai-shell memory rebuild-index

# Adjust cache size
ai-shell config set memory.cacheSize 10000
```

### Issue 4: Pattern Detection Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- AI-Shell doesn't detect obvious patterns
