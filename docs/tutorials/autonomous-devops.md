### Step 4: Enable Predictive Scaling

Let ADA automatically scale resources based on predicted demand:

```bash
# Enable predictive scaling
ai-shell ada scale enable --predictive

# Output:
# 📈 Enabling Predictive Auto-Scaling
#
# Analyzing workload patterns...
#   ✓ 14 days of metrics analyzed
#   ✓ Daily patterns identified
#   ✓ Weekly patterns identified
#   ✓ Monthly patterns identified
#   ✓ Special events detected (deploy days, batch jobs)
#
# Detected Patterns:
#
# Daily Pattern:
#   Low: 03:00-07:00 UTC (45 qps, 12% CPU)
#   Ramp-up: 07:00-09:00 UTC (gradual increase)
#   Peak: 09:00-17:00 UTC (234 qps, 42% CPU)
#   Ramp-down: 17:00-20:00 UTC (gradual decrease)
#   Evening: 20:00-03:00 UTC (89 qps, 23% CPU)
#
# Weekly Pattern:
#   Monday: High (start-of-week surge)
#   Tue-Thu: Moderate and consistent
#   Friday: Moderate (drops after 15:00)
#   Weekend: Low (30% of weekday traffic)
#
# Special Events:
#   - Deployment days: +25% traffic (health checks)
#   - 1st of month: +40% (batch processing)
#   - End of month: +15% (reporting)
#
# Scaling Strategy:
#
# Off-Peak (03:00-07:00):
#   Scale down: db.m5.medium → db.t3.small
#   Savings: $45/month (off-peak hours)
#   Risk: LOW (traffic minimal)
#
# Business Hours (09:00-17:00):
#   Maintain: db.m5.medium
#   Burst capacity: db.m5.large (if needed)
#   Trigger: CPU >70% for 5 minutes
#
# Predictive Pre-Scaling:
#   Monday mornings: Scale up 30min before traffic spike
#   Batch job days: Pre-allocate resources
#   Deploy days: Increase capacity proactively
#
# Configuration:
#   Prediction horizon: 2 hours

#   EU-West: $180/month (secondary)
#   AP-Southeast: $160/month (read-replica)
#   Total: $535/month
#
# Usage Analysis:
#   US-East: High utilization (optimal)
#   EU-West: Medium utilization (some headroom)
#   AP-Southeast: Low utilization (oversized)
#
# Recommendations:
#
# 1. Regional Right-Sizing
#    EU-West: Can reduce instance size
#    Savings: $45/month

## Advanced Features

### Custom Optimization Strategies

Define your own optimization logic:

```yaml
# ~/.ai-shell/ada/custom-strategies.yaml
custom_strategies:
  - name: aggressive_weekend_scaling
    description: "Aggressive scale-down on weekends"

    trigger:
      day_of_week: [6, 7]  # Saturday, Sunday
      time_range: "00:00-23:59"

    actions:
      - type: scale_instance
        target: db.t3.small
        safety_margin: 1.5x

      - type: reduce_connections
        target: 20

      - type: pause_background_jobs
        except: [critical_backups]

    expected_savings: 45%
    risk_level: low
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: ADA Not Finding Optimizations

**Symptoms:**
- Few or no recommendations
- No cost savings identified

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check baseline data
ai-shell ada baseline verify

# Extend analysis period
ai-shell ada analyze --period 30days

# Lower optimization threshold
ai-shell ada configure --min-savings 5%  # Default: 10%

# Force deep analysis
ai-shell ada analyze --deep
```

### Issue 2: Excessive Scaling Changes

**Symptoms:**
- Too many scale up/down events
- Instability

**Solution:**

```bash
# Increase stability threshold
ai-shell ada configure --stability-threshold 15m  # Increase from 5m

# Adjust sensitivity
ai-shell ada configure --scaling-sensitivity low

# Increase safety margins
ai-shell ada configure --safety-margin 2.0  # Increase from 1.5

# Review scaling logs
ai-shell ada scaling-log --analyze-frequency
```
