- Sample data in your database for testing
- Access to a development or test database (not production for learning)

### Verify Your Setup
```bash
# Check AI-Shell version
ai-shell --version
# Expected output: ai-shell v1.0.0 or higher

# Verify database connection
ai-shell query "show tables"
# Should display list of tables in your database

# Test AI connectivity
ai-shell query "how many tables do I have?"
# Should return a count of your tables
```

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Your First Natural Language Query

Let's start with simple queries to understand the basics.

```bash
# Count records in a table
ai-shell query "how many users do we have?"

# View recent records
ai-shell query "show me the last 10 orders"

# Find specific data
ai-shell query "find all active customers"
```

**What's Happening:**
- AI-Shell analyzes your natural language input
- Claude AI interprets your intent and database schema
- SQL query is generated and executed automatically
- Results are formatted for easy reading

**Expected Output:**
```
üîç Query: how many users do we have?
üìä SQL Generated:
SELECT COUNT(*) as user_count FROM users;

Results:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ user_count ‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ 1,247      ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

‚úì Query executed in 23ms
```

---

### Step 2: Filtering and Conditions

Natural language makes complex filtering intuitive.

```bash
# Date-based filtering
ai-shell query "show users who signed up this week"

# Multiple conditions
ai-shell query "find orders over $100 placed in the last 30 days"

# Status filtering
ai-shell query "show all pending orders from premium customers"

# Exclusion queries
ai-shell query "find users who haven't logged in for 90 days"
```

**Advanced Filtering Examples:**
```bash
# Range queries
ai-shell query "show products priced between $50 and $200"

# Pattern matching
ai-shell query "find customers with gmail email addresses"

# Null handling
ai-shell query "show users without a phone number"

# Boolean logic
ai-shell query "find orders that are either shipped or delivered"
```

**Pro Tip:** AI-Shell understands temporal references like "this week," "last month," "yesterday," and "last quarter."

---

### Step 3: Aggregations and Analytics

Perform complex analytics without writing GROUP BY clauses.

```bash
# Simple aggregations
ai-shell query "what's the average order value?"
ai-shell query "show total revenue by product category"

# Time-based analytics
ai-shell query "show daily signups for the last month"
ai-shell query "compare sales this quarter vs last quarter"

# Multi-level aggregations
ai-shell query "show top 10 customers by total spending"
ai-shell query "what's the average order value per customer segment?"

# Percentile queries
ai-shell query "show 95th percentile response time for API calls"
```

**Advanced Analytics:**
```bash
# Revenue analysis
ai-shell query "show revenue by product category this quarter, sorted by highest revenue"

# Customer insights
ai-shell query "find customers who made more than 5 purchases and spent over $1000"

# Growth metrics
ai-shell query "show month-over-month user growth for the past year"

# Conversion funnels
ai-shell query "show conversion rate from signup to first purchase"
```

---

### Step 4: Joining Data Across Tables

AI-Shell automatically determines relationships between tables.

```bash
# Simple joins
ai-shell query "show orders with customer names"

# Multiple table joins
ai-shell query "show order details with customer info and product names"

# Left joins (including nulls)
ai-shell query "show all users and their orders, including users with no orders"

# Complex relationships
ai-shell query "find customers who ordered products from the electronics category"
```

**Real-World Join Examples:**
```bash
# E-commerce analysis
ai-shell query "show customer names, order dates, and product names for orders placed this month"

# User activity analysis
ai-shell query "show users with their last login date and total number of sessions"

# Sales pipeline
ai-shell query "show deals with associated contact information and sales rep names"
```

**How AI-Shell Handles Joins:**
- Automatically detects foreign key relationships
- Infers table relationships from naming conventions
- Optimizes join order for performance
- Handles ambiguous references by asking for clarification

---

### Step 5: Sorting and Limiting Results

Control result ordering and size naturally.

```bash
# Sorting
ai-shell query "show top 10 products by sales"
ai-shell query "list customers alphabetically"
ai-shell query "show recent orders, newest first"

# Limiting results
ai-shell query "show 5 random products"
ai-shell query "give me a sample of 100 user records"

# Pagination hints
ai-shell query "show the next 20 products after skipping the first 40"
```

**Advanced Sorting:**
```bash
# Multi-column sorting
ai-shell query "show orders sorted by status, then by date descending"

# Conditional sorting
ai-shell query "show products sorted by price within each category"

# Complex ordering
ai-shell query "show top performers by sales volume, breaking ties by revenue"
```

---

### Step 6: Working with Dates and Times

AI-Shell excels at natural date/time handling.

```bash
# Relative dates
ai-shell query "show orders from yesterday"
ai-shell query "find users created in the last 7 days"
ai-shell query "show revenue for last quarter"

# Specific dates
ai-shell query "show orders placed on October 26, 2025"
ai-shell query "find users who signed up in Q3 2025"

# Date ranges
ai-shell query "show sales between January 1 and March 31, 2025"
ai-shell query "find orders from the past week excluding weekends"

# Time-based grouping
ai-shell query "show orders by day for the last 30 days"
ai-shell query "group revenue by month for this year"
ai-shell query "show average response time per hour over the last 24 hours"
```

**Supported Date Formats:**
- Relative: "today," "yesterday," "this week," "last month," "past year"
- Specific: "January 15, 2025," "2025-01-15," "Jan 15"
- Ranges: "between X and Y," "from X to Y"
- Periods: "Q1 2025," "March 2025," "week of Jan 15"

---

### Step 7: Context-Aware Querying

AI-Shell remembers context from previous queries for natural conversation flow.

```bash
# Initial query
ai-shell query "show all orders from last month"

# Follow-up queries (context maintained)
ai-shell query "filter those to only premium customers"
ai-shell query "now sort by order value descending"
ai-shell query "show me just the top 10"
ai-shell query "export those to CSV"

# Referencing previous results
ai-shell query "how many were there total?"
ai-shell query "what's the average order value?"
```

**Context Management:**
```bash
# Clear context when starting new analysis
ai-shell context clear

# Save context for later
ai-shell context save "monthly-order-analysis"

# Restore saved context
ai-shell context load "monthly-order-analysis"
```

---

### Step 8: Query Refinement and Iteration

Learn from AI-Shell's interpretations and refine your queries.

```bash
# Start broad
ai-shell query "show user activity"
# AI may ask: "Which activity metrics? (logins, purchases, page views, etc.)"

# Provide specifics
ai-shell query "show user logins for the past week"

# View generated SQL to understand interpretation
ai-shell query "show revenue by category" --show-sql

# Refine based on results
ai-shell query "show revenue by category for active products only"
```

**Understanding Query Interpretation:**
```bash
# Use explain mode to see how AI interprets your query
ai-shell query "show top customers" --explain

# Output shows:
# Interpretation:
#   - "top" interpreted as highest value metric
#   - Assumed metric: total_spending (you can specify others)
#   - Default limit: 10 (you can change this)
#   - Sorting: descending
#
# You can modify with:
#   - "top 20 customers by order count"
#   - "top customers by lifetime value"
```

---

### Step 9: Advanced Natural Language Patterns

Master sophisticated query patterns.

```bash
# Subqueries (automatically handled)
ai-shell query "show products that have never been ordered"
ai-shell query "find users whose spending is above average"

# Window functions (through natural language)
ai-shell query "show running total of revenue by date"
ai-shell query "rank products by sales within each category"

# Complex conditions
ai-shell query "find customers who ordered in January but not in February"
ai-shell query "show products with sales growing month over month"

# Statistical queries
ai-shell query "show standard deviation of order values by customer segment"
ai-shell query "calculate correlation between marketing spend and signup rate"
```

---

### Step 10: Handling Ambiguity and Clarifications

Learn how AI-Shell handles unclear requests.

**Example 1: Ambiguous Table References**
```bash
ai-shell query "show recent activity"

# AI-Shell responds:
# "I found multiple tables related to activity:
#  1. user_activity (user logins and actions)
#  2. system_activity (system logs)
#  3. purchase_activity (transaction logs)
# Which would you like to query?"

# You respond:
ai-shell query "the first one"
# or
ai-shell query "user activity"
```

**Example 2: Missing Context**
```bash
ai-shell query "show totals by category"

# AI-Shell responds:
# "What metric would you like totaled? (Examples: revenue, order_count, quantity)"

# You respond:
ai-shell query "revenue"
```

**Example 3: Ambiguous Time Periods**
```bash
ai-shell query "show weekly data"

# AI-Shell responds:
# "How many weeks of data? (Default: last 4 weeks)"

# You respond:
ai-shell query "last 12 weeks"
```

---

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Sales Analysis

**Scenario:** Analyze sales performance without SQL knowledge.

```bash
# Daily sales
ai-shell query "show daily revenue for the last 30 days"

# Product performance
ai-shell query "which products had the highest sales last month?"

# Customer segments
ai-shell query "compare revenue from new vs returning customers"

# Trends
ai-shell query "show month-over-month sales growth"

# Forecasting
ai-shell query "what's the average daily revenue? use that to project this month's total"
```

---

### Use Case 2: User Behavior Analysis

**Scenario:** Understand how users interact with your application.

```bash
# Engagement metrics
ai-shell query "show daily active users for the past week"

# Retention analysis
ai-shell query "how many users from last month are still active?"

# Feature usage
ai-shell query "show most popular features by user count"

# Cohort analysis
ai-shell query "group users by signup month and show retention rate"

# User journey
ai-shell query "show average time from signup to first purchase"
```

---

### Use Case 3: Operational Monitoring

**Scenario:** Monitor system health and performance.

```bash
# Error tracking
ai-shell query "show error count by type in the last hour"

# Performance monitoring
ai-shell query "show average API response time per endpoint today"

# Resource usage
ai-shell query "find database queries taking longer than 1 second"

# Anomaly detection
ai-shell query "show days where error rate was above average"

# Capacity planning
ai-shell query "show peak concurrent users by hour over the last week"
```

---

### Use Case 4: Customer Support

**Scenario:** Quickly access customer data for support inquiries.

```bash
# Customer lookup
ai-shell query "find customer with email john.doe@example.com"

# Order history
ai-shell query "show last 10 orders for customer ID 12345"

# Support tickets
ai-shell query "show open tickets for customers with premium subscriptions"

# Account status
ai-shell query "find customers with failed payment methods"

# Usage summary
ai-shell query "show total purchases and account age for customer 12345"
```

---

### Use Case 5: Marketing Analytics

**Scenario:** Measure campaign effectiveness and ROI.

```bash
# Campaign performance
ai-shell query "show signups by referral source this month"

# Conversion rates
ai-shell query "calculate conversion rate from trial to paid subscription"

# Customer acquisition cost
ai-shell query "show marketing spend per new customer by channel"

# Attribution analysis
ai-shell query "show first and last touch attribution for conversions"

# Segment analysis
ai-shell query "compare engagement rates across customer segments"
```

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Issue 1: Query Returns Unexpected Results

**Problem:** Results don't match what you expected.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# View the generated SQL to understand interpretation
ai-shell query "your query here" --show-sql

# Add more specificity to your query
# Instead of: "show users"
# Try: "show all user records with their email addresses"

# Use explicit date ranges
# Instead of: "show recent orders"
# Try: "show orders from the last 7 days"

# Specify sorting and limits
# Instead of: "show top customers"
# Try: "show top 10 customers by total spending, highest first"
```

---

### Issue 2: AI-Shell Asks Too Many Clarifying Questions

**Problem:** Query requires multiple follow-up questions.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Provide complete information upfront
# Instead of: "show sales"
# Try: "show total sales revenue by product category for Q3 2025"

# Be specific about:
# - Time periods: "last 30 days" vs "recently"
# - Metrics: "revenue" vs "performance"
# - Scope: "active users" vs "users"
# - Sorting: "top 10 by sales" vs "top products"

# Use explicit table names for ambiguous queries
# Instead of: "show activity"
# Try: "show records from user_activity table"
```

---

### Issue 3: Query Takes Too Long

**Problem:** Natural language query is slow to execute.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Add limits to large queries
ai-shell query "show first 100 orders from last year"

# Use date filters to reduce data volume
ai-shell query "show orders from last month" # instead of all orders

# Check the generated SQL for optimization opportunities
ai-shell query "your query" --show-sql --explain-plan

# Use the optimize command on slow queries
ai-shell optimize "your natural language query"

# Enable query caching for repeated queries
ai-shell config set performance.enableCache true
```

---

### Issue 4: AI Doesn't Understand Domain-Specific Terms

**Problem:** Your business uses unique terminology that AI-Shell doesn't recognize.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Define custom aliases for your terminology
ai-shell alias add "deals" "opportunities table"
ai-shell alias add "ARR" "annual recurring revenue"

# Use table and column names explicitly
# Instead of: "show MRR"
# Try: "show sum of monthly_revenue column"

# Provide context in your query
ai-shell query "show 'opportunities' which we call deals"

# Train AI-Shell with examples
ai-shell train "when I say 'active deals', query opportunities where status='open'"
```

---

### Issue 5: Results Format Is Hard to Read

**Problem:** Query results are not formatted as needed.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Specify output format
ai-shell query "show users" --format table
ai-shell query "show users" --format json
ai-shell query "show users" --format csv

# Request specific columns
ai-shell query "show only user names and emails"

# Control result size
ai-shell query "show first 20 users"

# Export to file
ai-shell query "show all orders" --export orders.csv

# Use pretty-print for large results
ai-shell query "show users" --pretty
```

---

### Issue 6: Cannot Query Specific Edge Cases

**Problem:** Complex edge cases aren't handled well by natural language.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Fall back to SQL for complex queries
ai-shell execute "SELECT ... your SQL here ..."

# Break complex queries into steps
ai-shell query "show all orders" --save temp_orders
ai-shell query "from temp_orders, show those over $100"

# Combine natural language with SQL hints
ai-shell query "show users (use LEFT JOIN with orders table)"

# Use the query builder for complex scenarios
ai-shell build-query
# Follow interactive prompts
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Then Add Complexity

```bash
# Start with basic query
ai-shell query "show orders"

# Add time filter
ai-shell query "show orders from last month"

# Add additional filters
ai-shell query "show orders from last month where amount > 100"

# Add aggregation
ai-shell query "show total revenue from orders last month where amount > 100"
```

### 2. Be Explicit About Intent

```bash
# Vague
ai-shell query "show data"

# Better
ai-shell query "show user signup data"

# Best
ai-shell query "show count of user signups by date for the last 30 days"
```

### 3. Use Consistent Terminology

```bash
# Maintain consistency in how you refer to concepts
# Always use "customers" or always use "users", not both
# This helps AI-Shell learn your patterns
```

### 4. Leverage Context for Related Queries

```bash
# Efficient use of context
ai-shell query "show orders from last month"
ai-shell query "filter to premium customers"
ai-shell query "sort by order value"
ai-shell query "export to CSV"

# Context automatically maintained across queries
```

### 5. Validate Results on Unfamiliar Queries

```bash
# For new query types, verify the SQL
ai-shell query "your new query pattern" --show-sql

# Check row count makes sense
ai-shell query "how many results in previous query?"

# Spot-check a few records
ai-shell query "show 5 random samples from previous results"
```

### 6. Save and Reuse Common Queries

```bash
# Save frequently used queries as aliases
ai-shell alias add "daily-sales" "show total revenue by date for last 30 days"

# Use saved queries
ai-shell query daily-sales

# List all saved queries
ai-shell alias list

# Create query templates
ai-shell template create "revenue-by-period" \
  "show total revenue for [period]"

# Use template
ai-shell query revenue-by-period --period "last quarter"
```

### 7. Use Natural Language for Exploration, SQL for Production

```bash
# Exploration phase - use natural language
ai-shell query "show me interesting patterns in user signups"

# Once you know what you need - get the SQL
ai-shell query "show daily signups with 7-day moving average" --show-sql

# Copy SQL to your application code for production use
# Natural language is great for ad-hoc analysis, but
# SQL is better for reliable, repeatable production queries
```
