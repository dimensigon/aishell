```

#### Section 2: Natural Language Commands (4 minutes)
**Timestamp: 7:00 - 11:00**

```
[Visual: Terminal with AIShell running]

"One of AIShell's most powerful features is natural language understanding.
You can express commands in plain English, and AIShell will interpret
and execute them.

Let's look at some examples across different categories.

[Demo: File Operations]
AI$ create a file called config.json with database settings

[Show AIShell understanding and executing]

AIShell understood that we want to:
1. Create a new file
2. Name it config.json
3. Add database configuration

[Demo: Database Operations]
AI$ show me all users created in the last 7 days

[Show query execution and results]

Notice how AIShell:
- Understood the time reference
- Constructed the appropriate SQL query
- Executed it safely with proper validation

[Demo: System Operations]
AI$ check if the database service is running and show memory usage

[Show multi-part command execution]

AIShell can handle complex, multi-part requests and break them down
into individual operations.

[Show list of 33 NLP patterns]

AIShell supports 33 different natural language patterns across:
- File operations (7 patterns)
- Database operations (8 patterns)
- System operations (6 patterns)
- Agent operations (5 patterns)
- Workflow operations (4 patterns)
- Analysis operations (3 patterns)

All of these are documented in the Quick Reference Guide."
```

#### Section 3: Autonomous Agents (6 minutes)
**Timestamp: 11:00 - 17:00**

```
[Visual: Agent architecture diagram]

"Now let's explore AIShell's autonomous agent system - one of its most
powerful features.

Agents are AI-powered components that can:
- Plan multi-step tasks
- Execute complex workflows
- Handle errors and recovery
- Persist state across sessions

Let's build a simple backup agent together.

[Screen: Code editor with agent template]

Every agent extends the BaseAgent class and implements three key methods:

1. plan() - Generate execution plan
2. execute_step() - Execute individual steps
3. validate_safety() - Assess operation safety

[Type code with explanations:]

```python
class BackupAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def plan(self, task: TaskContext):
        # LLM generates optimal plan
        return await self.llm_manager.generate_plan(task)

    async def execute_step(self, step: Dict):
        # Execute with tool registry
        tool = self.tool_registry.get_tool(step['tool'])
        return await tool.execute(step['params'])

    def validate_safety(self, step: Dict):
        # Assess risk level
        return {'safe': True, 'risk_level': 'medium'}
```

[Switch to terminal]

Now let's run our agent:

AI$ run backup agent for production database

[Show agent execution with real-time updates:]
- Planning phase (3 steps identified)
- Execution phase (progress for each step)
- Validation phase (results verification)

[Show checkpoint creation]

Notice the checkpoints being created? This allows the agent to resume
if interrupted.

[Demo checkpoint restoration:]

AI$ list checkpoints for task backup_prod_001
AI$ restore checkpoint after_backup

This is incredibly powerful for long-running operations."
```

#### Section 4: Tool Registry & Safety (5 minutes)
**Timestamp: 17:00 - 22:00**

```
[Visual: Tool registry diagram]

"Agents use tools from the tool registry. Every tool is:

✓ Validated with JSON schema
✓ Risk-classified (5 levels)
✓ Capability-gated
✓ Rate-limited
✓ Audit-logged

Let's register a custom tool.

[Screen: Tool definition JSON]

```json
{
  "name": "database_backup",
  "category": "database",
  "risk_level": "medium",
  "description": "Create database backup",
  "parameters_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "database": {"type": "string"},
      "output_path": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["database"]
  },
  "capabilities_required": [
    "DATABASE_READ",
    "BACKUP_CREATE"
  ]
}
```

[Terminal: Register tool]

AI$ register tool from database_backup.json

[Show validation and registration]

Now let's look at the safety system.

[Demo: High-risk operation]

AI$ delete all records from users table where created_at < '2020-01-01'

[Show risk assessment:]
⚠️  HIGH RISK OPERATION DETECTED
- Risk Level: HIGH
- Reason: DELETE operation without confirmation
- Records affected: ~15,000
- Requires: Human approval

[Show approval prompt:]
Continue? [y/N]:

This human-in-the-loop approval prevents accidental data loss.

[Show audit log:]
All operations are logged:
- Who executed it
- When it happened
- What was changed
- Result status

Perfect for compliance and debugging."
```

```

#### Section 1: Basic Health Checks (3 minutes)
**Timestamp: 1:00 - 4:00**

```
[Visual: Code editor]

"Let's start with a basic health check implementation.

[Type code with explanations:]

```python
async def check_database_health() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    \"\"\"Check database connectivity and latency\"\"\"
    try:
        start = time.time()

        # Test connection
        async with db_pool.acquire() as conn:
            await conn.execute('SELECT 1')

        latency = time.time() - start

        return {
            'status': 'healthy',
            'latency_ms': latency * 1000,
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            'status': 'unhealthy',
            'error': str(e),
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
```

[Terminal: Run the check]

AI$ python test_health.py

[Show output]

This basic pattern works, but we can do better with async operations..."
```

#### Section 2: Parallel Health Checks (4 minutes)
**Timestamp: 4:00 - 8:00**

```
[Visual: Diagram showing parallel execution]

"In production, you want to check multiple components simultaneously.
Let's use asyncio.gather for parallel execution.

[Code editor:]

```python
async def check_all_components():
    \"\"\"Check all components in parallel\"\"\"

    # Define all checks
    checks = {
        'database': check_database_health(),
        'llm': check_llm_health(),
        'filesystem': check_filesystem_health(),
        'memory': check_memory_health()
    }

    # Execute in parallel
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        *checks.values(),
        return_exceptions=True
    )

    # Map results back to component names
    component_health = {}
    for (name, _), result in zip(checks.items(), results):
        if isinstance(result, Exception):
            component_health[name] = {
                'status': 'error',
                'error': str(result)
            }
        else:
            component_health[name] = result

    # Determine overall status
    all_healthy = all(
        h.get('status') == 'healthy'
        for h in component_health.values()
    )

    return {
        'overall': 'healthy' if all_healthy else 'degraded',
        'components': component_health,
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

[Terminal: Demo parallel execution]

[Show timing comparison:]
Sequential: 2.4 seconds
Parallel: 0.6 seconds

4x faster! This matters in production when you have dozens of checks."
```

#### Section 3: Timeout Protection (3 minutes)
**Timestamp: 8:00 - 11:00**

```
[Visual: Timeout scenario animation]

"What if a component hangs? We need timeout protection.

[Code editor:]

```python
async def check_with_timeout(
    check_func: Callable,
    timeout: float = 5.0
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    \"\"\"Execute health check with timeout\"\"\"
    try:
        return await asyncio.wait_for(
            check_func(),
            timeout=timeout
        )
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        return {
            'status': 'timeout',
            'error': f'Check exceeded {timeout}s timeout',
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
        }

async def robust_health_check():
    \"\"\"Health check with timeout protection\"\"\"
    checks = {
        'database': check_with_timeout(
            check_database_health,
            timeout=10.0
        ),
        'llm': check_with_timeout(
            check_llm_health,
            timeout=5.0
        )
    }

    return await asyncio.gather(*checks.values())
```

[Terminal: Demo timeout scenario]

[Simulate slow component]

    async def check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        \"\"\"Check API health\"\"\"
        try:
            start = time.time()

            async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
                async with session.get(
                    f\"{self.api_url}/health\",
                    timeout=5.0
                ) as response:
                    latency = time.time() - start
                    status_ok = response.status == 200

                    result = {
                        'status': 'healthy' if status_ok else 'unhealthy',
